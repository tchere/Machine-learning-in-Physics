# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning in Physics


## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
We apply different supervised machine learning techinques to solve the physics problem, including the 2-D classical Ising model, classification problem and the second order polynomial equation.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Linear Regression (including gradient descent, steepest descent and conjugate descent)
- Regularization (principle of Lagrange multiplier)
- Logistic Regression (physics example: Fermi-Dirac distribution from Statistical mechanics)
- Support Vector Machine
- Principal Component Analysis
- K-mean clustering
- Neural Network (forward and backward propagation)
